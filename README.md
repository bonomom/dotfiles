# Dotfiles

This is a set of the dotfiles I use for my unix setups. Feel free to use and
distribute them, but I'm not responsible if these break your system.

## Installation

If you trust me, here's a one-line installation.

`git clone https://github.com/nicholastmosher/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles; ~/.dotfiles/install.sh`

## Quick Overview

So far in the dotfiles I've got configurations for git (.gitconfig and
.gitignore_global), vim (highly borrowed from
[Harlan's vim setup](https://github.com/harlanhaskins/harlan-vimrc)), tmux,
and various bash configurations.
