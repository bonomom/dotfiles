# Dotfiles

This is a set of the dotfiles I use for my unix setups. Feel free to use and
distribute them, but I'm not responsible if these break your system.

## Installation

If you trust me, here's a one-line installation for all of my dotfiles.

`git clone https://github.com/nicholastmosher/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles; ~/.dotfiles/install.sh`

If you want to install only my vim setup, here's a one-liner:

`git clone https://github.com/nicholastmosher/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles; ~/.dotfiles/vim/install.sh`

## Quick Overview

So far in the dotfiles I've got configurations for git (`.gitconfig` and
`.gitignore_global`), vim (highly borrowed from
[Harlan's vim setup](https://github.com/harlanhaskins/harlan-vimrc)), tmux, i3,
and various bash configurations.
